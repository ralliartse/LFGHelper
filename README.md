<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is simply to show the LFG and LFM posting in a simple GUI.<br>
It has been developped and tested with TurtleWoW.<br>
You will need to filter which instances you are interested in, and wait. In the option(s), you will be able to choose when to auto-remove the postings.<br>
It might not catch ALL of the postings, but most of them.<br>
If the poster is LFG, an invite button will show up beside his name. If the poster is LFM, a whisper button will show.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the repository and put it in your /Interface/AddOns/ directory.<br> The location will looks like c:/twmoa/Interface/AddOns/LFGHelper/

<h2>Feedback/Suggestions</h2>
Don't be shy to contact me for suggestions, feedbacks.

<h2>Quick fix</h2>
If something is not working correctly, delete the files LFGHelper.lua and LFGHelper.lua.bak inside your WoWDirectory/WTF/Account/YourAccount/SavedVariables folder.<br>If it still doesn't work, submit the bug.
